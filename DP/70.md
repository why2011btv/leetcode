Yes, the recurrence relation inherently handles the combinations such that duplicated counts (overlapping ways) are avoided and efficiently calculated. Let's delve deeper to understand how:

### Understanding the Recurrence Relation
The recurrence relation `ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)` signifies that:
- `ways(n-1)` counts all the ways to reach the `(n-1)`-th step, and from there, you take one more step to reach the `n`-th step.
- `ways(n-2)` counts all the ways to reach the `(n-2)`-th step, and from there, you take two more steps to reach the `n`-th step.

### Exploration of Overlapping Ways

Let's break this down with an example:

#### Example: \( n = 4 \)

- To reach the 4th step, you can:
  - Take 1 step from the 3rd step.
  - Take 2 steps from the 2nd step.

#### Detailing Each Path

For `ways(4)`, we will explore paths as they cumulate:

1. `ways(3) + 1 step to 4th step`:
   - The possibilities to reach the 3rd step (`ways(3)`) include:
     - From `ways(2) + 1 step`
     - From `ways(1) + 2 steps`

   Thus:
   ```
   ways(3) = ways(2) + ways(1)
   ```

2. `ways(2) + 2 steps to 4th step`:
   - The possibilities to reach the 2nd step (`ways(2)`) include:
     - From `ways(1) + 1 step`
     - From `ways(0) + 2 steps`

   Thus:
   ```
   ways(2) = ways(1) + ways(0)
   ```

#### Substitution Pathways and Cumulation
Breaking down and substituting, we cumulate as follows for general \(n\):

- Overall pathways to reach `4th step`:

\[
\begin{align*}
ways(4) & = ways(3) + ways(2) \\
& = (ways(2) + ways(1)) + (ways(1) + ways(0)) \\
& = ((ways(1) + ways(0)) + ways(1)) + (ways(1) + ways(0)) \\
\end{align*}
\]
Simply putting:
- From each step previously considered, there are ways which lead up to it in a unique combination preventing overlaps beyond the intrinsic nature of the combination counts:
  - Here the paths are exclusively leading uniquely forward since they are summed from recursively previous unique builds up, avoiding recounting same pathways beyond those which independently form them.

### Directly Counted Pathways:
#### For `n=4` barriers are:
\[
4: \text{Each count considered uniquely built through discrete path summation as } (\text{bounded uniquely + avoided redundant recursion})
\]

In conclusion:
The recurrence relation isnâ€™t leading to duplicate or overlap conflicted pathways inherently, ensuring from Dynamic Programming effectively tabulated `state storage` resolving through unique counted states onward without re-evaluating conflicts. Thus overlapping scenarios are inherently avoided through discrete addition mechanisms accommodating step jumps combined singularly.
