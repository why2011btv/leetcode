To solve the House Robber problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The main idea is to use a DP array (`dp`) where each element `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to the `i-th` house without triggering the alarm.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Define the State:**
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the first `i` houses.

2. **State Transition:**
   - For each house `i`, there are two options:
     - Do not rob the `i-th` house, in which case the total amount of money is the same as `dp[i-1]`.
     - Rob the `i-th` house, in which case the total amount of money is the money from the `i-th` house (`nums[i]`) plus the maximum amount of money robbed from the houses up to the `(i-2)`-th house (`dp[i-2]`).
   - Thus, `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-2])`.

3. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0]`: Robbing only the first house.
   - `dp[1]`: Maximum of robbing the first house or the second house.

4. **Result:**
   - The answer is the maximum money that can be robbed from all the houses, which is stored in `dp[n-1]`.

### Implementation

Here's the Python code implementing the above approach:

```python
def rob(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return nums[0]

    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])

    for i in range(2, n):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-2])

    return dp[n-1]
```

### Explanation

1. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0] = nums[0]`: The maximum money robbing just the first house.
   - `dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])`: The maximum money robbing either the first house or the second house but not both.

2. **State Transition:**
   - For each house `i` from 2 to `n-1`, calculate `dp[i]` as the maximum of:
     - Not robbing the current house (`dp[i-1]`).
     - Robbing the current house (`nums[i]` + `dp[i-2]`).

3. **Final Result:**
   - The value in `dp[n-1]` will give the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without triggering the alarm.

### Space Optimization

We can optimize the space complexity to \(O(1)\) by noting that we only need to store the last two values to compute the current value (similar to the Fibonacci sequence approach).

Here's the space-optimized implementation:

```python
def rob(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return nums[0]

    prev1 = nums[0]
    prev2 = max(nums[0], nums[1])

    for i in range(2, n):
        current = max(prev2, nums[i] + prev1)
        prev1 = prev2
        prev2 = current

    return prev2
```

### Explanation

1. **Base Cases:**
   - `prev1` stores the maximum money robbing just up to the first house.
   - `prev2` stores the maximum money robbing up to the second house.

2. **Iterate and Update:**
   - For each house from index 2 to `n-1`, calculate the current maximum using the same state transition logic.
   - Update `prev1` and `prev2` accordingly.

3. **Final Result:**
   - After the loop, `prev2` will contain the maximum amount of money that can be robbed.

This approach ensures efficient computation in \(O(n)\) time complexity with constant space \(O(1)\).
